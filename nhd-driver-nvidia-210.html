I am trying to pass a GTX 210 to my Windows 8.1 (will be updated to 10) Vm. As you can probably guess this is not for gaming but rather for my IT Job. I get the infamous error code 43 for the Nvidia Driver. I will post my domain.xml first thing in the morning (I am at home now). But I have tried the suggestion posted on the Arch Wiki. I am using an UEFI Bios through OMVF with a Legacy GPU. I don't know if this is the issue or not. If so What are my options? I have already tried adding hv_ven.

I have a crappy old pc which I put steam OS on as its used for media and streaming problem is, the gpu is a crappy geforce 210, and BPM runs like crap. Theres resolution options in desktop BPM but not steamOS bpm, is there a way to force it to run in 720p? Also my TV is one of those tvs that upscales to 1080p from 960x540, so 720p looks better on it anyway another issue is its capping streams at 50fps, the refresh rate of my tv, this causes HORRIBLE tearing in games running  Примеры ошибок и способы их исправления  Если у вас возникли проблемы с установкой драйверов для вашей видеокарты nVidia, не отчаивайтесь. every menu is like this and the game is just a blackscreen i can solve. 
NVIDIA GeForce (Game Ready Driver) 376.09 (для настольных ПК) Драйвер видеокарты NVIDIA GeForce. Версия: 376.09 WHQL (28.11.2016). Hello, I have an ATI HD5450, and it works really bad with my Linux Mint. I'm thinking about upgrading the card to something more powerful (and 100% compatible with Linux!). Can you recommend me a good ATI or Nvidia silent (fanless) graphics card? FYI, my computer is an AMD Athlon II X3-450 with a Gigabyte motherboard (I don't remember the model.). Important: I use a dual-screen setup, so I need a graphics card with two screen connectors.

The past few weeks I'm plagued by making a monitor selection since I'm upgrading to RTX 2080 and would like to move from 1080P/144Hz to 1440P/144Hz. I'm coming from a BenQ XL2411Z. So far I'm still in the gap of picking TN vs IPS. Motion clarity is a big thing for me since I'm used to playing fast paced shooters and generally FPS but now also looking to go into a more casual approach of vibrant colours and deep blacks for singleplayer games. So far I'm into these choices I have been trying to get the GTX 1050 Ti working on the Dell XPS 15 9570 with the nvidia-xrun-pm package. I boot into a normal xserver and start kde. Then swicht to tty2 and reun nvidia-xrun. The GPU correctly powers on and appears in the list generated by lspci but then xserver starts shows a black screen for about a second and shuts down and the GPU is turned off. The nvidia and nvidia\_drm modules are black listed and are not listed in lsmod. Seeking help of builders with linux knowledge.

Hi Guys, We are using pretty old Nvidia Geforce 210 GPU which have not been update for few years now, I mention this however I am unsure if this really matters. since 1809 update in 5 classrooms out of 20 some computer will sometimes have no audio. I check and see that everything is turned up to full, device manager shows no errors with drivers and shows 4 for nvidia Geforce for audio and 1 realtek.

Just a heads up, I've been sitting at like 120-130 FPS with frame drops into the 50's briefly during my matches for a while now. I was confused because an 8700k and GTX1080 should absolutely destroy this game. I thought it was latency, but I've upgraded my wifi solution and have good latency. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I downloaded some bloatware that claimed to let you know all the drivers that are out of date. My Nvidia driver was an entire generation old (3.X.X vs new 4.X.X)!. I am trying to add another graphics card to my desktop so that I can connect more displays to it. Currently I have a 750ti and I dug up an old nvidia 210 GPU. My motherboard has another slot, so I figured I could just put it in there. After I did that, Windows tried to load and got stuck with a black screen with the loading swirly dots, but my mouse pointer appeared. I could move the mouse between all 5 displays (2 on the 210, 3 on the 750ti) which made me think it was working. Then after Hello, My sound will pop and crackle primarily when playing system sounds, pausing and playing video especially on Youtube, working within a digital audio work station (Bitwig), and when doing things on the computer while a video is playing. It will also make poppy sounds simply while a video is running or when audio is playing, but it will do so less when that is the case. If I shut the computer down the speakers will make a gross whine on shutdown and startup (they didn't
